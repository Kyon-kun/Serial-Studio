# Architecture — IO & Drivers

## IO Architecture — No Singleton Drivers

- 10 drivers, **public ctors**, no `static instance()`.
- `ConnectionManager` (singleton, `Cpp_IO_Manager`) owns one **UI-config** instance per type:
  `instance().uart()`, `.network()`, `.bluetoothLE()`, etc. QML context properties
  (`Cpp_IO_Serial`, etc.) point at these.
- `createDriver()` makes **fresh** instances for live connections, owned by `DeviceManager`.
- `configurationOk()` checks the **UI** driver, not the live one. UI driver's
  `configurationChanged` forwards to `ConnectionManager::configurationChanged`. All drivers
  must `Q_EMIT configurationChanged()` from their ctor.
- Live drivers may have empty device lists. UART/Modbus call `refreshSerialDevices()` /
  `refreshSerialPorts()` in `open()` if empty.

## File Transmission (Pro)

`IO::FileTransmission` + `IO::Protocols::*`: controller +
XMODEM/YMODEM/ZMODEM. Incoming data routes from `ConnectionManager::onRawDataReceived` →
`FileTransmission::onRawDataReceived` (guarded by `active()`). Protocols emit
`writeRequested(QByteArray)`; controller calls `ConnectionManager::writeData()`.
